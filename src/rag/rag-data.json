This led me to apply to study Computer science in the University. During my university years I am building on improving my tech skills, I enrolled in the Frontend Engineering program at AltSchool Africa, where I improved my Frontend skills. As I built more projects, I fell in love with creating interfaces that feel intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. During my third year of uni, in my second semester, I went for my SIWES(IT) which lasted a period of six months. During my IT period I explored other tech fields and my interest expanded into UI/UX design, cloud engineering and automation, which led me to explore AWS, Terraform, AI/ML and backend concepts during my SIWES internship. Today, I enjoy combining strong frontend skills with backend knowledge to build scalable, real-world applications."
