    "content": "I started my tech journey fresh out of highschool out of curiosity and a desire to understand how the apps and websites I used every day were built. This led me to apply to study Computer Science in the University. During my university years I worked on improving my tech skills and enrolled in the Frontend Engineering program at AltSchool Africa, where I enhanced my frontend skills. As I built more projects, I fell in love with creating interfaces that feel intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing. During my third year of uni, in my second semester, I went for my SIWES internship which lasted six months. During this period, I explored other tech fields and expanded my interests into UI/UX design, cloud engineering, automation, AWS, Terraform, AI/ML, and backend concepts. Today, I enjoy combining strong frontend skills with backend knowledge to build scalable, real-world applications."
